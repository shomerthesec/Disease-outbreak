  A project for a friend of mine. 
  The data shows the num. of infected people in a location for a certain date and weather conditions.

 ## The processes done:
  * Cleaning the data and preparing it.
  * Regression and forecasting the number of cases each day. 
  * Classification for the number of infected people, High/Medium/Low.
